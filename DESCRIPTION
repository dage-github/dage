Description: Headandnecksquamouscellcarcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common 
    cancer of the body, with common risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption,
    betel nut chewing and Humanpapillomavirus (HPV) infection. Studies have shown 
    that HPV infection can affect the clinical and immunomolecular characteristics 
    of tumours and therefore patient prognosis, and thus HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC are also 
    considered to be two distinct clinical solid tumours. Current clinical practice 
    is still dominated by the traditional combination of surgery, radiotherapy and 
    chemotherapy based on anatomical site and clinical staging, which are often 
    associated with significant recurrence rates and recurrence often leads to poor 
    prognosis and lack of alternative treatment options. Individualised treatment based 
    on molecular subtypes has the potential to change this traditional treatment 
    paradigm by improving the precision of treatment. Immunophenotypes closely 
    associated with survival prognosis and treatment response in HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC 
    were identified at the immunogenetic level, and the immunophenotypes 
    classifier for identifying single-sample RNA sequencing data of HNSCC was developed 
    and validated with internal and external datasets.
